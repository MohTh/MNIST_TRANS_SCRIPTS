# MNIST_TRANS_SCRIPTS
Scripts for time evaluation of mnist classification with analog MAC operations using Spectre simulation.

# How does it work? 
This repository provides all the scripts that allow the testing of MNIST classification using an Analog MAC cell in Spectre simulation envirement. Configurations are provided for bothe TSMC65 PDK and the Cadence GPDK180. It can be used with other technologies with simple configuration, it will be detailed below. 

# Requirements: 
- A fully set up Cadence work envirnment, with the alias "spectre" to run Spectre. 
- Python 3.10 envirenement with the libraries (Other versions will most likely work, but only the specified ones were tested): 
  > torch 2.3.0
  > numpy 1.26.4
